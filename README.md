## üìñ Usage

### Basic Setup
1. Navigate to **Users > Bulk Cleanup Pro** in your WordPress admin
2. Configure your deletion criteria:
   - **Delete users without names**: Remove users missing both first and last names
   - **Domain filtering**: Specify allowed email domains (comma-separated)
   - **Role deletion**: Select a specific role to delete (administrators excluded)
   - **WooCommerce options**: Delete orders and coupons by status
   - **Batch size**: Choose processing speed vs. server load balance

### Running the Cleanup Process

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always backup your database before running bulk cleanup operations!

1. Click **"Start Deletion Process"**
2. **Scanning Phase**: The plugin will scan all users and WooCommerce data to identify deletion candidates
3. **Deletion Phase**: Users, orders, and coupons will be deleted in batches with real-time progress updates
4. **Completion**: Review the detailed log of all operations

### Configuration Options

#### Batch Size Selection
- **50 (Slower, safest)**: Best for shared hosting or limited resources
- **100 (Recommended)**: Balanced performance for most setups
- **250 (Faster)**: Good for VPS with adequate resources
- **500 (Fast)**: Suitable for dedicated servers
- **1000 (Very fast, advanced)**: High-performance servers only

#### Deletion Criteria
- **No Name Filter**: Targets users with empty first_name AND last_name meta fields
- **Domain Filter**: Allows only specified email domains (e.g., `company.com,partner.org`)
- **Role Filter**: Removes all users with the selected role (never affects administrators)
- **WooCommerce Orders**: Delete orders by status (pending, completed, cancelled, etc.)
- **WooCommerce Coupons**: Delete coupons by status (published, draft, trash, etc.)

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses WordPress transients instead of loading all user IDs into memory
- **Paginated Scanning**: Processes users in batches of 1,000 during scanning phase
- **Safe Database Operations**: Proper prepared statements and error handling
- **Cache Management**: Automatic cleanup of WordPress user caches

### Database Operations
```php
// Safe user metadata deletion
$wpdb->delete( $wpdb->usermeta, array( 'user_id' => $user_id ), array( '%d' ) );

// WordPress core user deletion
wp_delete_user( $user_id );

// WooCommerce order deletion
$order->delete( true ); // Force delete

// WooCommerce coupon deletion
wp_delete_post( $coupon_id, true ); // Force delete
```

### Security Features
- **Nonce Verification**: All AJAX requests include WordPress nonces
- **Capability Checks**: Requires `manage_options` capability
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are properly sanitized
- **Admin Protection**: Multiple checks prevent administrator deletion

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

| User Count | Scanning Time | Deletion Time (100/batch) |
|------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 10,000     | ~30 seconds   | ~5 minutes               |
| 100,000    | ~5 minutes    | ~45 minutes              |
| 1,000,000  | ~45 minutes   | ~7 hours                 |

*Times vary based on server performance and criteria complexity*

## üö® Safety Guidelines

### Before Running
1. **Create a full database backup**
2. **Test on a staging environment first**
3. **Verify your criteria settings carefully**
4. **Ensure you have administrator access via other means**

### During Operation
- **Don't close the browser tab** during processing
- **Monitor server resources** for large operations
- **Check error logs** if issues occur

### After Completion
- **Review the operation log** for any errors
- **Verify expected users were deleted**
- **Check site functionality**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Scan state lost" Error
- **Cause**: Transient expired or server restart
- **Solution**: Restart the cleanup process

#### Memory Limit Errors
- **Cause**: Insufficient PHP memory
- **Solution**: Reduce batch size or increase PHP memory limit

#### Timeout Errors
- **Cause**: Long-running operations
- **Solution**: Use smaller batch sizes or increase execution time

#### Network Errors
- **Cause**: AJAX timeout or connection issues
- **Solution**: Check network connection and server logs

### Debug Mode
Enable WordPress debug mode to get detailed error information:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```
